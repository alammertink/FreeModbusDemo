Yes, your strategy is absolutely valid and **very common** in STM32CubeMX-based workflows where:

- You regenerate STM32CubeMX code from a known clean baseline.
- You want to **rebase your custom development** (AI-generated code, drivers, etc.) **on top of** a new auto-generated base.
  
---

## âœ… What You Want

You want to:
1. Merge `development` into `main` **now** (for versioning / release).
2. Keep `a64ca19` (the STM32CubeMX base with BSP and TIM7) as a **rebase anchor** so that **in the future**, you can regenerate new STM32CubeMX code from that or a similar point and reapply your custom changes cleanly using `rebase`.

## ðŸ”§ Merge Now, Rebase Later: The Workflow

### Step 1: Merge `development` into `main`
This gives you a snapshot of your current working software:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge development
git push origin main
```

---

### Step 2: Tag or Branch from CubeMX Baseline
Tag the clean STM32CubeMX commit (e.g. `a64ca19`) for easy reference:
```bash
git tag cubemx_base a64ca19
git push origin cubemx_base
```

Or optionally:
```bash
git branch cubemx_base a64ca19
git push origin cubemx_base
```

---

### Step 3: Rebase Workflow (Future CubeMX Regeneration)
Whenever you regenerate CubeMX code:

1. Check out a **temporary working branch** from the base:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b cubemx_update cubemx_base
   ```

2. Overwrite it with new CubeMX-generated code (after changing settings).

3. Commit regenerated code:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Regenerated code from CubeMX with updated peripherals"
   ```

4. Rebase your development work on top of the regenerated base:
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git rebase cubemx_update
   ```

   > If there are conflicts, resolve them one by one, then `git rebase --continue`.

---

## ðŸ§  Summary
- You're following a **clean STM32CubeMX â†’ rebase custom code** pattern â€” very solid for long-term maintainability.
- Use tags or branches to mark CubeMX milestones.
- Rebase your development when you regenerate code â€” this keeps your custom code on top of new hardware configs.
